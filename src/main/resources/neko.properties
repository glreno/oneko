# Distances
#

# Distance that the mouse must move to wake up the sleeping kitten
triggerDistance=64
# How fast the kitty runs
runDistancePerFrame=16

# offset from the mouse (pixels) that the kitty will be chasing.
offsetx=-2
offsety=-3
# how close the kitty needs to get to the mouse
catchDistance=2

# The difference between catchDistance and offset is that the
# catchDistance lets the kitty miss the goal by a bit.
# The offset actually moves the goal. As long as offset>catchDistance,
# the kitty shouldn't interfere with the mouse too much.

# Framerates for various animations (frames per second)
# Keep in mind there are only two frames per animation!
